# Unit-10-Full-Stack
 A client side built in react allowing user interface to an api managed database

 To use:

 After downloading files, navigate to the root directory in your terminal.

 Then navigate to the api file with:

 ```
$ cd/api
 ```
 and run
 ```
:api $ npm install
:api $ npm start
 ```
 Open another terminal and navigate to the client directory:
 ```
$ cd/client
 ```
 and run
```
:client $ npm install
:client $ npm start
```
This should open the browser and begin running the client side on localhost:3000 and the api
running on localhost:5000
